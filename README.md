Convert Kiro accounts to OpenAI / Anthropic compatible API service.

[English](README.md) | [中文](README_CN.md)

If this project helps you, a Star would mean a lot.

## Features

- Anthropic `/v1/messages` & OpenAI `/v1/chat/completions`
- Multi-account pool with round-robin load balancing
- Auto token refresh, SSE streaming, Web admin panel
- Multiple auth: AWS Builder ID, IAM Identity Center (Enterprise SSO), SSO Token, local cache, credentials JSON
- Usage tracking, account import/export, i18n (CN / EN)
- Support configuring outbound proxy (SOCKS5 / HTTP)

## Quick Start

### Docker Compose (Recommended)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Quorinex/Kiro-Go.git
cd Kiro-Go
mkdir -p data
docker-compose up -d
```

### Docker Run

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name kiro-go \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -e ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_secure_password \
  -v /path/to/data:/app/data \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  ghcr.io/quorinex/kiro-go:latest
```

### Build from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Quorinex/Kiro-Go.git
cd Kiro-Go
go build -o kiro-go .
./kiro-go
```

### Deploy on Zeabur

The repo already includes a `Dockerfile`, so it builds and runs on Zeabur out of the box.

**Option 1: Dashboard (one-click)**

1. Fork this repo to your GitHub account.
2. In Zeabur, create a new service and choose **Deploy from GitHub**, then select your fork.
3. Zeabur auto-detects the `Dockerfile` and builds the image.
4. In the **Networking** tab, expose port `8080` and bind a domain.
5. In the **Variables** tab, set at least `ADMIN_PASSWORD` (admin panel password).
6. Mount a Volume at `/app/data` if you want accounts / config to survive redeploys.

**Option 2: CLI**

```bash
npm i -g zeabur
zeabur auth login
zeabur deploy
```

> Run the commands from the project root. The CLI writes `.zeabur/context.json` to remember the target project / service — it contains personal IDs, so don't commit it.

Once the service is up, open `https://<your-domain>/admin` to log in.

Config is auto-created at `data/config.json`. Mount `/app/data` for persistence. The default admin password is `changeme` — override it via the `ADMIN_PASSWORD` env var or change it in the admin panel before going to production.

## Usage

Open `http://localhost:8080/admin`, log in, add accounts, then call the API:

```bash
# Claude
curl http://localhost:8080/v1/messages \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  -d '{"model":"claude-sonnet-4.5","max_tokens":1024,"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Hello!"}]}'

# OpenAI
curl http://localhost:8080/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer any" \
  -d '{"model":"gpt-4o","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Hello!"}]}'
```

## Thinking Mode

Append a suffix (default `-thinking`) to the model name, e.g. `claude-sonnet-4.5-thinking`. Claude-compatible requests that include a top-level `thinking` config such as `{"type":"enabled","budget_tokens":2048}` or `{"type":"adaptive"}` also enable thinking mode automatically. Configure output format in the admin panel under Settings - Thinking Mode.

## Outbound Proxy

For users in restricted network regions, configure an outbound proxy in the admin panel under **Settings - Outbound Proxy Settings**. Supports SOCKS5 and HTTP proxies.

The setting takes effect immediately without restarting.

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `CONFIG_PATH` | Config file path | `data/config.json` |
| `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | Admin panel password (overrides config) | - |

## Contributing

Friendly discussion is welcome. If you run into issues, try asking Claude Code, Codex, or similar tools for help first — most problems can be solved that way. PRs are even better.
